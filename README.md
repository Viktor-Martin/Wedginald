# Wedginald

Possibly the most useless of the bunch. Wedginald is just a markov chain text algorithm created for fun and the amusement of my friends.

The code is a mess, and I need to go through it again and rewrite it to be less sloppy as I haven't touched it in ~3 years; if it ain't broke don't fix it type deal.

## Why would you want this?

I don't know, it's completely useless but can be fun with some time to build a file documenting messages to use to feed the chain. Wedginald learns from those who he's around.

## How do I install it?

Again I don't know ðŸ’€ it's been so long. If my memory serves me right you'd need to:
- Install node.js
- Open the folder in a terminal and run `node init`
- Go through the setup and then run `npm i` to install the dependancies
- Finally run `node wedgi.js`
- You will also need to edit wedgi.js to insert your own token.

Something like that.
